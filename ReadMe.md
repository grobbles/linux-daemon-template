# Linux Daemon Template

## Description

This a simple linux daemon with the following functions:

-   this daemon create a own log file in /var/log/"DaemonName"
-   read the configration from /etc/"DaemonName"/"DaemonName".conf
-   the daemon start automaticlley with systemd

## Needed tools

-   CMake
-   Make
-   C++ compiler

## Start Development

Checkout this project

```bash
    git clone git@github.com:grobbles/linux-daemon-template.git
    cd linux-daemon-template
```

Run the main script to initialize the project and initialize the git submodules (gtest)

```bash
     ./rund.sh -i
```

To build the project run the scpript with following command

```bash
     ./rund.sh -b
```

To install the daemon in your system and start the daemon run the main script. This command build also the daemon.

```bash
     sudo ./rund.sh -s
```

## IDE

The daemon template project is optimized for visual studio code IDE.

## Git Workflow

-   master branch
-   feature branch
-   bugfix branch

If you want to add a new feature than create a new branch from master branch and commit your stuff to the branch. If you think you are done than create a merge request.

## Software versioning

It give three segments. "Major version"."Minor version"."Patch version"

1. Major version - incremented for backwards-incompatible changes
    - Major version must be incremented manually in the 'setup.py' file.
    - It will be read only the Major version from the file. The other version numbers will be ignore and will be override from script.
2. Minor version - incremented for new, backwards-compatible functionality is introduced to the API
    - Minor version will be incremented automatically if a feature branch merged in the master branch.
3. Patch version - incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes
    - Patch version will be incremented automatically if a bugfix branch merged in the master branch.

Example:

```python
    0.9.0 # merge a bugfix branch
    0.9.1 # merge a bugfix branch
    0.9.2 # merge a bugfix branch
    ...
    0.9.10
    0.9.11
    1.0.0 # the project is in a stable state and can be release.
    1.0.1 # merge a bugfix branch
    1.1.0 # merge a feature branch
    2.0.0 # merge a feature branch with a incompatible API change
    2.0.1 # merge a bugfix branch
```
